        Anyways, let me give you a rundown about this thing. At first I wanted this website to be my digital home, initially to be called "Internet Cave". Uppon looking at domain names, I realized I would have to come up with something more creative. Getting a ".com" seemed quite enterprisy and something like ".io" would have been super hipseter and cool. However the idea of a network seemed challenging but interesting. I came up with the idea of an expandable version of internet cave. A social media for people who do not want to be limited to a pictures or videos. I wanted to create  a medium for interactive experiences. Rather than wall people would have a domain name at their disposal. In order to tie everything together there would be a symple file system based around mySQL in order to allow many websites to display the best content of their whole aggregate collection.

        While these are my hopes, this list and page organization will have to do for now. I told myself I would have this done by monday a week ago. Welp, its here now, I will have more soon, definitely hoping on posting multiple times a day as soon as integrate the user system of ear7h-net4 (what you are reading is being served from the 5th generation of the website).

        Enjoy!
